    <h1 id="Swami vivekananda">Swami vivekananda </h1>
    <p>Swami Vivekananda ; 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta (Bengali: [nɔrendronatʰ dɔto]), was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna.[4][5] He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world[6][7][8] and the Father of modern Indian nationalism and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion.[9]</p>
    <h1 id="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
    <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, also known as Mahatma Gandhi, who was born on 2nd October 1869 in Porbandar. Mahatma Gandhi was an Indian writer, social activist, politician, and lawyer. He also founded the nationalist movement against the British invaders’ rule in India. 

        Avoiding violence while dedicating to a singular cause. As a result of his efforts, people remember him as the “Father of the Nation.”
        
        Aside from that, he held religious beliefs. He and his family have been following a form of Vaishnavism, one of Hinduism’s major traditions, infusing with the morally strict tenets of Jainism. Jainism is an important Indian faith that teaches concepts such as asceticism and nonviolence. Beliefs shaping Gandhi’s spiritual outlook later in life were influenced by his upbringing in some way. As he encountered new belief systems, his understanding of faith shifted.
        
        Knowing Mahatma Gandhi’s contributions to India’s struggle for independence is crucial for every citizen. If you are thinking to pen his life story, then write a compelling Mahatma Gandhi essay adding these pointers! </p>
        <h1 id="Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar">Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</h1>
        <p>Bhimrao was born into a Hindu Maharashtrian family of the ‘Mahaar’ caste on April 14, 1891, in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh. People from this caste were once known as ‘untouchables.’ He became a Buddhist in 1956.
            Despite their ability to attend school, Ambedkar and other children of this caste separated from their peers and received little attention or support from their teachers. They were not permitted to enter the classroom. If the untouchables wanted water, a higher caste member would have to pour it from a height because they were not allowed to touch the water or the vessel that contained it. This was normally done for Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the peon was unavailable, he had to go without water, a circumstance he subsequently characterized in his works as “No peon, No Water.” He had to sit on a gunny bag, which he was required to bring home with him at all times.
            Ambedkar was the world’s only person to stage a Satyagraha for clean drinking water.
            He was the first lawyer from a lower caste to practice law. His first name was Ambawedkar, but his teacher changed it to Ambedkar at school.</p>

        <h1 id="Jawaharlal Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</h1>
        <p>The first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, was a remarkable leader who was instrumental in the Independence cause. He was also a superb writer and public speaker. Nehru was not only a leader; he also made contributions in the spheres of politics and education.

                On November 14, 1889, in Allahabad, Jawaharlal Nehru was born (India). After completing his education at Cambridge University and Harrow School (London), he chose to study law despite his parents’ wishes for him to become an engineer (England). After arriving back in India from England, he enrolled at the Allahabad High Court and began practicing law there for 15 years before joining the fight to end British authority over India.</p>
        <H1 id="Srinivasa Ramanujan">Srinivasa Ramanujan</H1>
        <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan FRS (/ˈsrinɪvɑsə rɑːˈmɑːnʊdʒən/ SREE-nih-vah-sə rah-MAH-nuuj-ən;[1] born Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar, Tamil: [sriːniʋaːsa ɾaːmaːnud͡ʑan ajːaŋgar]; 22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920)[2][3] was an Indian mathematician. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.
        
                    Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation. According to Hans Eysenck, "he tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered".[4] Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a postal correspondence with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England. Recognising Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. In his notes, Hardy commented that Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that "defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before",[5] and some recently proven but highly advanced results.</p>
        
        
        <h1 id="Indira Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</h1>
        <p>Indira Gandhi, the first female prime minister of India, was a great leader. She served as prime minister from 1966 until her assassination in 1977 by her bodyguards. She was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru.

                    In many ways, she was an effective leader. She had a superb sense of direction, for instance, so that no one could ever get lost while following her (and this is why India is still on top of its game today). The crowds that gathered around Indira whenever she appeared in public were so sizable that it was impossible to manage them. She was also an exceptional speaker.</p>

        <h1 id="A. P. J. Abdul Kalam">A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</h1>
        <p>A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, a scientist, and statesman served as India’s eleventh president from 2002 until 2007. In India, he is referred to as the ‘Missile Man’ for developing ballistic missiles and launchers.

            He worked as an aeronautical engineer with the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), Defense Industries Department (DID), Liquid Propulsion System Centre (LPSC), and Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO). He was instrumental in the development of the country’s nuclear, space, and missile programs (ISRO).</p>

        <h1 id="Aryabhatta">Aryabhatta</h1>
        <p>Math, astronomy, and science are just a few of the subjects that Aryabhatta excelled in. He created the “Aryabhatiya,” a comprehensive book that covered a wide variety of integral themes in mathematics, such as trigonometry and algebra. 

            He was the first to offer an approximation of the value of pi and to make several other mathematical deductions. His contribution to mathematics was unique as the originator of the Number system.</p>
